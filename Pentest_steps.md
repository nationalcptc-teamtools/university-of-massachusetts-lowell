# Penetration Test Live Guide:
This guide does not have specific command, but has phases, prupose of each phase, outlines what proof is for a phase, and tools related to properly execute that phase.


## 1. Recon + Intial
1st phase would be to conduct Scanning on the network given. Scan IP ranges, In addition, there are networking tools that provide and capture packet information.

Objective: Organize our information. Identiy Hosts, exposed services, domains, & web apps. 

### Create Network Inventory & Reports
Do not start anything without completing this step first.
- Create Network Inventory
- On the same document, create tables for mini-docs, which will be used to house machine specific information and screenshots during each phase of the pen test.
    Copy the **Technical Findings** section from the main report
    For each inital service or possible exploitable point of entry(i.e cve, service, misconfig) create a **Technical Findings** section in the per-machine mini-doc.

- 3 of us perform an Nmap Scan on the 1 subnet and add the machines to the spreadsheet. 

- 3 of us perform an Nmap Scan on the 2 subnet and add the machines to the spreadsheet  

#### Scanning IP Blocks
    - Nmap
        Has custom scripts which can capture detailed response data.
#### Word list scanning
#### Network Traffic Monitoring
    Use Packet capture tools such as
    - Wire shark
    - tcp dump
    - suricate
    to log both network flow, headers, and body of reponding traffic.
#### Internet Scanners
    - Masscan
    - Nmap
#### Web Scanners
    - FFuF
    - Gobuster 
    - Nikto
    - WhatWeb
    - Wappalyzer
#### Sub Domains/Webapps
    - Amass
    - Subfinder

### Team member to Machine
- Each team member will get a machine/share a machine. EVERY machine must have  **mini-doc for it pre-created** before moving on to phase 2.

Output proof For catalogubg: Functioning invenory.csv, EVERY team member is assigned a machine & IT IS PROPERLY INDICATED IN THE NETWORK CSV.

Also EACH per-machine mini-doc, needs to have been created before moving on the PHASE 2.

## 2. Vulnerability Assesment
Objective: Identify Weakness in opearting systems, services & web apps for potential exploitation
Why: Need a possible point of entry that can eventually be exploited

### Webapp
- Burp/ZAP → Crawl + passive issues; targeted active checks on high-value flows.
- sqlmap/XSStrike/wpscan → Focused probes where parameters/engines suggest risk.

### OS/Service(running on ports)

- Nessus/Greenbone/OpenVAS → Host CVEs to shortlist; verify versions.
- Searchsploit/Exploit-DB → Map versions → known exploits; feasibility triage.

#### Network

- SMB/LDAP/SNMP NSE & smbmap/smbclient/snmpwalk → Anonymous/writable shares, weak SNMP communities.
- Responder (detect-only mode for recon) → See if LLMNR/NBNS is in play (engage per RoE).
- TCP dump - May need to find information being sent over the network.

Output proof For Document writeup/catalog: inventory.csv (Redteam internal Infra tracking) (host, IP, ports, service, app, owner), screenshots of admin panels, TLS cert maps.


## 3. Inital Access
Goal: Gain application/session access to a system
Pre-req(s): Network Inventorm; inventory.csv, Network Diagram

### Webapp
- Burp Repeater/ZAP → Validate auth bypass, IDOR, file-upload logic, SSRF.
- sqlmap (surgical) → Only after manual confirmation; target one promising param.

### OS/Service
- Hydra/Medusa/CrackMapExec → Credential testing (permitted accounts only).
- Metasploit (known, patched CVEs in lab) → Controlled PoC for service RCE.

### Network
- Responder + ntlmrelayx (Impacket) → If LLMNR/NTLM allowed, attempt ethical relay to low-risk targets.
- Bettercap (policy-compliant modules) → Test for on-path weaknesses in lab.

Output proof For Document writeup/catalog: Exact HTTP requests/responses, session proof, minimal shell/banner evidence.


## 4. Execution x Foothold
Goal: Achieve a stable reproducible foothold, that'll give way for pivoting to other machines and subnets

### Webapp
-Minimal webshells, Burp-driven actions → Confirm code path safely.

### OS/Service
- Netcat/Socat/Meterpreter → Establish session; log everything.
- LinPEAS/WinPEAS → run a scan using LinePeas/WinPeas to collect local misconfigs and priv-esc hints.
    - This can give access to misonconfigs, which can be further exploited.
### Network
- tshark/tcpdump → Observe network traffic to see if confidential info is being sent over the wire
    - can reveal locations that data is being send to interally or externally, which can lead to 2nd, level or 3rd lelve infrastructure surface area which may be compromisable
- Nmap  scan - Can reveal subnets which were only accessible after having access to a 2nd level machine.
    - Proxy chains are useful. Allows you to run commands that seem to originate from the victum machine,
    without having to install software on the victim machine. 

- Additional tasks: 
    - Remeber to perform Additional scans once in different  levels of the infra structure.

Output proof For Document writeup/catalog: shell logs (whoami/hostname/id), PEAS reports, process/network snapshots.

## 5. Privilege  Escalation & Persisience
Goal: Elevate privileges; optionally install reversible, document persistence.
Why: This can further convey the true extent of what adversarys can do using the methods that led them to this phase of the "cyber attack",pentest in our case. Nice report element.
Pre-req(s): Needs some time of compromised user access

### Webapp
- Session hardening checks → Token scope; role escalation bugs; admin panels reachable?

### OS/Service
- GTFOBins/LOLBAS/PEAS → SUID/sudo misconfigs, service path issues, kernel CVEs (lab).
- Credential discovery → .env, config files, key stores.

### Network
- Kerberoasting/AS-REP  → If Active Directory is present targeted roast via Impacket.
- Wide range/reusable Service trusts → Re-use app/DB creds against management interfaces.

Output proof For Document writeup/catalog:


## Lateral movement & Internal Recon w. credential access: 
Goal: Use captured creds/sessions to reach adjacent systems and data.

### Webapp
- API credential reuse → Try tokens/keys across sibling services and staging.

### OS/Service
- Impacket (psexec/wmiexec/secretsdump), CrackMapExec → Authenticated reach across subnets.
- SSH/Proxychains/Chisel → Light pivoting for scoped internal scans.

### Network
- Nmap from pivot → Enumerate only the most promising internal ranges/ports.
- smbmap/smbclient → Enumerate shares; copy metadata (not live data) for PoC.

Priority outputs: New host inventory, successful authenticated actions, diagrams of pivot path.


## Report
### Mini-docs per machine "Technical Findings"
Each claim, proof of compromise, possible misconfig should have a screenshot. More is better here. Since this is the mini-doc thats in the excel sheet, you can add images of every step, but provide a caption of what is happening.

### Main report
If you did the previous section properly, it will be easy to pick and choose the most effective screenshots to write this report. Be specific, meaning don't screen shot you entire terminal, if you must, edit the image and add circles, Numbers, than explain in detail what's happening and what it proves.
